#How to fork and clone a repository
Next, you'll want to fork the repository. You won't be allowed to push changes directly to the repository, so instead you'll make a fork which is a copy of the project that's under your control.

The "Fork" button is at the top-right of the repository page.
Next, clone the repository locally. This pulls a copy of everything in the repository to your machine so you can start working on it.

We'll do this in the terminal. If you're on Windows you can use Command Prompt or PowerShell.

Go to an appropriate location on your file system like your Downloads or Documents directory, then execute this following:

Clone the repository you want to work on.
Enter the directory in the terminal.
Link the repository with the fork on your account.
